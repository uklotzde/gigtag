A lightweight, textual tagging system aimed at DJs for managing custom metadata.

## Structure

A _gig tag_ is a flat structure with the following, pre-defined fields or components:

- Label
- Facet
- Prop(ertie)s

All components are optional with the following restrictions:

- A valid _gig tag_ must have a _label_ or a _facet_
- If a _gig tag_ has a _facet_ it must also have a _label_ or _props_

### Label

A _label_ is a non-empty, case-aware string that contains freeform text without
leading/trailing whitespace.

Labels are supposed to be edited by users and are displayed verbatim in the UI.

#### Examples

|Label|Comment|
|---|---|
|`Wishlist`|a single word|
|`FloorFiller`|multiple words concatenated in _PascalCase_|
|`Floor Filler`|multiple words separated by whitespace|

### Facet

The same content rules that apply to _labels_ also apply to _facets_.

Facets serve a different semantic purpose than labels. They are used for
categorizing, namespacing or grouping a set of labels or for defining the
context of associated properties.

Facets are supposed to encode pre-defined identifiers that are neither
editable nor directly displayed in the UI.

Facets that consist of 8 decimal digits have a special meaning: Those
numbers encode ISO 8601 calendar dates without a time zone in the format
`yyyyMMdd`. These so called _date facets_ are used for anchoring tags
chronologically.

#### Examples

|Facet|Comment|
|---|---|
|`audio-features`|a tag for encoding Spotify/EchoNest audio features|
|`20220625`|a _date facet_ that denotes the calendar day 2022-06-25 in any time zone|
|`20220625 Some Text`|an ordinary facet that does not denote a date, even though it is prefixed with 8 decimal digits that could denote a date|

### Prop(ertie)s

Custom _properties_ could be attached to tags, abbreviated as _props_.

Properties are represented as a non-empty, ordered _list_ of key/value pairs.

Both keys and values are arbitrary strings that could even include
leading/trailing whitespace. There are no restrictions regarding the
uniqueness of keys, i.e. duplicate keys are permitted.

Applications are responsible for interpreting the keys and values in their
respective context. Facets could be used for defining this context.

## Serialization

### Single tag

Individual tags are encoded as [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax)s:

> `URI       = scheme ":" ["//" authority] path ["?" query] ["#" fragment]`
> `authority = [userinfo "@"] host [":" port]`

Only the _path_, _query_, and _fragment_ components could be present.
All other components must be absent, i.e. the URI string must neither
contain a _scheme_ nor an _authority_ component.

The following table defines the component mapping:

|Tag component|URI component|
|---|---|
|label|[fragment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_fragment)|
|facet|path|
|props|[query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)|

Tags, respective their URIs, are serialized as text and
[percent-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)
according to RFC 2396/1738.

Empty components are considered as absent when parsing a _gig tag_
from an URI string.

A valid _gig tag_ URI contains either a single `?` character, or a
single `#` character, or both of them. This is also beneficial for
distinguishing encoded _gig tags_ from arbitrary text.

#### Examples

The following examples show variations of the encoded string with empty components
that are ignored when decoding the URI.

|Encoded|Facet|Label|Props: Keys|Props: Values
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`#MyTag`<br>`?#MyTag`||`MyTag`|
|`20220625#Someone%27s%20wishlist%20for%20this%20day%`<br>`20220625?#Someone%27s%20wishlist%20for%20this%20day%`|`20220625`|`Someone's wishlist for this day`|
|`audio-features?energy=0.78&valence=0.61`<br>`audio-features?energy=0.78&valence=0.61#`|`audio-features`||`energy`<br>`valence`|`0.78`<br>`0.61`|

#### Examples (invalid)

The following tokens do not represent valid _gig tags_:

|Encoded|Comment|
|---|---|
|`https://#MyTag`|scheme is present|
|`https://#MyTag`|scheme is present|
|`MyTag`|only a facet, but neither a label nor props|
|`#`|empty label is considered as absent|
|`?`|empty facet and props are considered as absent|
|`?#`|empty facet, props, and label are considered as absent|

### Multiple tags

#### Formatting

Multiple tags are formatted and stored as text by concatenating the corresponding,
encoded URIs. Subsequent URIs are separated by whitespace, e.g. a single ASCII space character.

##### Retro-fitting

Often it is not possible to store the encoded _gig tags_ in a reserved field.
In this case _gig tags_ could appended to any text field by separating them
with arbitrary whitespace from the preceding text.

#### Parsing

Text is split into tokens that are separated by whitespace. Parsing starts with the last
token and continues from back to front. It stops when encountering a token that could
not be parsed as a valid _gig tag_.

##### Retro-fitting

The first token that could not be parsed as a valid _gig tag_ is considered the last
token of the preceding text. The preceding text including this token and the whitespace
until the first valid _gig tag_ token must be preserved as an _undecoded prefix_.

When re-encoding the _gig tags_ the _undecoded prefix_ that was captured during parsing
must be prepended to the re-encoded _gig tags_ string. This rule ensures that only
whitespace characters could get lost during a decode/re-encode roundtrip, i.e. when
unintentionally parsing arbitrary words from the preceding text as valid _gig tags_
(false positives).

## Storage

### File metadata

The text with the encoded _gig tags_ is appended (separated by whitespace) to the
_Content Group_ field of audio files:

- ID3v2: `GRP1` (primary/preferred) / `TIT11` (traditional/fallback)
- Vorbis: `GROUPING`
- MPEG-4: `Â©grp`
